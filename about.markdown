# About Me

My name is Nikhil Mukunda. I am a technical writer and information architect with nine years of experience. I currently work at Philips B.V, Amsterdam.

I have always been a storyteller and a tech enthusiast. This combination has ensured that I have loved my job as a software technical writer every day for the past nine years. The question I ask myself every day at work is “Who is my audience”. With this question, I am able to put myself in the shoes of a developer, a consumer, or even a decision-maker. It also aids me in
breaking down and structuring complex technical information into easy to understand documents and videos.

In my previous job with SAP, I have worked with software development teams in India, China,Canada, and Germany. I have worked using the agile methodology with multiple Scrum teams
and worked with DITA Technology to deliver documentation. I have also created videos that were showcased in SAP TechEd and to customers and developers.

I am an avid public speaker, continually honing my leadership skills at Toastmasters International. I love traveling and photography, the charm of exploring new places, interacting with different people, and being exposed to their stories.

I look forward to hearing from you
